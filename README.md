## CuMadness
Implementation of a solution for the CuMadness problem using Prolog. For more information about the implementation and how it works, see the report: ![CuMadness Report.pdf](https://github.com/NFSS10/PLOG-Logic-Programming/blob/master/Trabalhos/Trabalho%202/PLOG_TP2_CuMadness_3/cuMadness.pdf)

### How to run
In SICStus do:
1ยบ consult -> "main.pl"
2ยบ Get the solution by executing: "solveCube(X,N)." where N is the size of edge of the cube to solve (N > 0).

A solution is then showed and the user is asked to interact with the console. The user can then: execute "n." for another solution or execute "y." to close the console.
